This is a repository includes some of python scrits which I used during work. 

The scripts in ML (machine learning) folder are used for CNN, boosting traing, as well as a set of tools for analyzing, testing and evaluating trained models are .

A couple of some offical scritps, such as numpy and opencv, are also given here to help you make your python scripts.
