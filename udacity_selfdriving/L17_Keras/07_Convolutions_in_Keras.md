## Convolutions

1. Build from the previous network.
2. Add a [convolutional layer](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#convolution2d) with 32 filters, a 3x3 kernel, and valid padding before the flatten layer.
3. Add a ReLU activation after the convolutional layer.
4. Train for 3 epochs again, should be able to get over 50% accuracy.

Hint: The Keras example of a [convolutional neural](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py) network for MNIST would be a good example to review.
