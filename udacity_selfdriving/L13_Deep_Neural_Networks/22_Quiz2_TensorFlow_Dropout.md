This quiz will be starting with the code from the ReLU Quiz and applying a dropout layer. Build a model with a ReLU layer and dropout layer using the `keep_prob` placeholder to pass in a probability of 0.5. Print the logits from the model.

Note: Output will be different every time the code is run. This is caused by dropout randomizing the units it drops.
