# TensorFlow Neural Network Lab

![image](../data/L12_37.png)

We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of creating a single layer neural network in TensorFlow.

## The Notebook

The notebook has 3 problems for you to solve:
- Problem 1: Normalize the features
- Problem 2: Use TensorFlow operations to create features, labels, weight, and biases tensors
- Problem 3: Tune the learning rate, number of steps, and batch size for the best accuracy

This is a self-assessed lab. Compare your answers to the solutions in the "solutions.ipynb". If you have any difficulty completing the lab, Udacity provides a few services to answer any questions you might have.
