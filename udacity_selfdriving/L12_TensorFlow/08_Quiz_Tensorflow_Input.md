## Input
In the last section, you passed a tensor into a session and it
returned the result. What if you want to use a non-constant? This is where
`tf.placeholder()` and `feed_dict` come into place. In this section, you'll go
over the basics of feeding data into TensorFlow.

---
### `tf.placeholder()`
Sadly you can’t just set `x` to your dataset and put it in TensorFlow, because
over time you'll want your TensorFlow model to take in different datasets with
different parameters. You need `tf.placeholder()`!

`tf.placeholder()` returns a
tensor that gets its value from data passed to the `tf.session.run()` function,
allowing you to set the input right before the session runs.


----
### Session’s `feed_dict`

 ```python
x = tf.placeholder(tf.string)
with tf.Session() as sess:`  
    output = sess.run(x, feed_dict={x: 'Hello World'})
 ```

Use the `feed_dict parameter` in `tf.session.run()` to set the placeholder tensor. The above example shows the tensor `x` being set to the string "Hello, world". It's also possible to set more than one tensor using `feed_dict` as shown below.

 ```python
x = tf.placeholder(tf.string)
y =
tf.placeholder(tf.int32)
z = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)

with tf.Session() as
sess:
    output = sess.run(x, feed_dict={x: 'Test String', y: 123, z: 45.67})
 ```

**Note:** If the data passed to the `feed_dict` doesn’t match the tensor type and can’t be cast into the tensor type, you’ll get the error “ValueError: invalid literal for...”.

## Quiz

Let's see how well you understand
`tf.placeholder()` and `feed_dict`. The code below throws an error, but I want
you to make it return the number `123`. Change line 11, so that the code returns
the number `123`.
