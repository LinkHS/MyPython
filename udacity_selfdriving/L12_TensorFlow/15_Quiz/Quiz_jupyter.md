## Running the Grader
To run the grader below, you'll want to run the above
training from scratch (if you have otherwise already ran it multiple times). You
can reset your kernel and then run all cells for the grader code to
appropriately check that you weights and biases achieved the desired end result.

```{.python .input}
### DON'T MODIFY ANYTHING BELOW ###
### Be sure to run all cells above before running this cell ###
import grader

try:
    grader.run_grader(get_weights, get_biases, linear)
except Exception as err:
    print(str(err))
```
