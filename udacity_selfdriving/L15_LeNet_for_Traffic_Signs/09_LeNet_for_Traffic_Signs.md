## Strategies to Improve Your Classification Model
Looking at where to go next what could you do to further improve this model? There are several broad categories, to try.
- experiment with different network architectures, or just change the dimensions of the LeNet layers
- add regularization features like drop out or L2 regularization to make sure the network doesn't overfit the training data
- tune the hyperparameters
- improve the data pre-processing with steps like normalization and setting a zero mean
- augment the training data by rotating or shifting images or by changing colors

There are a lot of fun experiments you can run on this network so give it a shot and see how well you can do. Good luck.
