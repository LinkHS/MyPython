## LeNet for Traffic Signs
In the Convolutional Neural Networks lession we used LeNet with the MNIST data set. This following lesson is a walkthrough on how to use LeNet with MNIST and how to leverage this process and the LeNet architecture to classify traffic signs. This work was orginally intended for a local or AWS GPU instance, but should now be conducted using a workspace
