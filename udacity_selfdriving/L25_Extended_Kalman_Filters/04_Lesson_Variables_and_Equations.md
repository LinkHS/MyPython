In order to help you following along with the derivations of the  Kalman Filter equations in this lesson, we're providing a handy dandy  cheat sheet (actually "sheets", because there are a few pages). I want  to call your attention to the resources panel on the left (see the  screenshot below) where you can find a PDF copy of this cheat sheet  entitled "Sensor Fusion EKF Reference.pdf."

Download it and keep going with the lesson!
