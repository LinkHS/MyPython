The next few quizzes will test your understanding of `pooling layers`.

**Quiz**  
A pooling layer is generally used to ... (multiple choices)
- Increase the size of the output
- Decrease the size of the output
- Prevent overfitting
- Gain information


**Ans**  
The correct answer is **decrease the size of the output** and **prevent overfitting**. Reducing overfitting is a consequence of the reducing the output size, which in turn, reduces the number of parameters in future layers.
