<h1 align="center">TensorFlow Neural Network Lab</h1>

<img src="image/notmnist.png">
In this lab, you'll use all the tools you learned from *Introduction to TensorFlow* to label images of English letters! The data you are using, <a href="http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html">notMNIST</a>, consists of images of a letter from A to J in differents font.

The above images are a few examples of the data you'll be training on. After training the network, you will compare your prediction model against test data. Your goal, by the end of this lab, is to make predictions against that test set with at least an 80% accuracy. Let's jump in!

To start this lab, you first need to import all the necessary modules. Run the code below. If it runs successfully, it will print "`All modules imported`".

```{.python .input}
import hashlib
import os
import pickle
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelBinarizer
from sklearn.utils import resample
from tqdm import tqdm
from zipfile import ZipFile

print('All modules imported.')
```

The notMNIST dataset is too large for many computers to handle.  It contains 500,000 images for just training.  You'll be using a subset of this data, 15,000 images for each label (A-J).

## Problem 1
The first problem involves normalizing the features for your training and test data.

Implement Min-Max scaling in the `normalize()` function to a range of `a=0.1` and `b=0.9`. After scaling, the values of the pixels in the input data should range from 0.1 to 0.9.

Since the raw notMNIST image data is in [grayscale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayscale), the current values range from a min of 0 to a max of 255.

Min-Max Scaling:
$
X'=a+{\frac {\left(X-X_{\min }\right)\left(b-a\right)}{X_{\max }-X_{\min }}}
$

*If you're having trouble solving problem 1, you can view the solution [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab/blob/master/solutions.ipynb).*

## Problem 2
For the neural network to train on your data, you need the following <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/dtypes/DType">float32</a> tensors:

 - `features`
  - Placeholder tensor for feature data (`train_features`/`valid_features`/`test_features`)
 - `labels`
  - Placeholder tensor for label data (`train_labels`/`valid_labels`/`test_labels`)
 - `weights`
  - Variable Tensor with random numbers from a truncated normal distribution.
    - See <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/random/truncated_normal">`tf.truncated_normal()` documentation</a> for help.
 - `biases`
  - Variable Tensor with all zeros.
    - See <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/zeros"> `tf.zeros()` documentation</a> for help.

*If you're having trouble solving problem 2, review "TensorFlow Linear Function" section of the class.  If that doesn't help, the solution for this problem is available [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab/blob/master/solutions.ipynb).*

## Problem 3
Below are 3 parameter configurations for training the neural network. In each configuration, one of the parameters has multiple options. For each configuration, choose the option that gives the best acccuracy.

Parameter configurations:

Configuration 1
* **Epochs:** 1
* **Batch Size:**
  * 2000
  * 1000
  * 500
  * 300
  * 50
* **Learning Rate:** 0.01

Configuration 2
* **Epochs:** 1
* **Batch Size:** 100
* **Learning Rate:**
  * 0.8
  * 0.5
  * 0.1
  * 0.05
  * 0.01

Configuration 3
* **Epochs:**
  * 1
  * 2
  * 3
  * 4
  * 5
* **Batch Size:** 100
* **Learning Rate:** 0.2

The code will print out a Loss and Accuracy graph, so you can see how well the neural network performed.

## Test
Set the epochs, batch_size, and learning_rate with the best learning parameters you discovered in problem 3.  You're going to test your model against your hold out dataset/testing data.  This will give you a good indicator of how well the model will do in the real world.  You should have a test accuracy of at least 80%.
