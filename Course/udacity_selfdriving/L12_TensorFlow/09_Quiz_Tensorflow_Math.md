## TensorFlow Math
Getting the input is great, but now you need to use it. You're going to use basic math functions that everyone knows and loves - add, subtract, multiply, and divide - with tensors. (There's many more math functions you can check out in the documentation.)

### Addition

```python
x = tf.add(5, 2)  # 7
 ```
 
You’ll start with the add function. The `tf.add()` function does exactly what you expect it to do. It takes in two numbers, two tensors, or one of each, and returns their sum as a tensor.

### Subtraction and Multiplication
Here’s an example with subtraction and multiplication.
 ```python
x = tf.subtract(10, 4) # 6
y = tf.multiply(2, 5)  # 10
  ```
 
The `x` tensor will evaluate to `6`, because `10 - 4 = 6`. The `y` tensor will evaluate to `10`, because `2 * 5 = 10`. That was easy!

### Converting types
It may be necessary to convert between types to make certain operators work together. For example, if you tried the following, it would fail with an exception:

 ```python
tf.subtract(tf.constant(2.0),tf.constant(1))  # Fails with ValueError: Tensor conversion requested dtype float32 for Tensor with dtype int32:
 ```
That's because the constant `1` is an integer but the constant `2.0` is a floating point value and subtract expects them to match.

In cases like these, you can either make sure your data is all of the same type, or you can cast a value to another type. In this case, converting the `2.0` to an integer before subtracting, like so, will give the correct result:

 ```python
tf.subtract(tf.cast(tf.constant(2.0), tf.int32), tf.constant(1))   # 1
 ```

## Quiz
Let's apply what you learned to convert an algorithm to TensorFlow. The code below is a simple algorithm using division and subtraction. Convert the following algorithm in regular Python to TensorFlow and print the results of the session. You can use `tf.constant()` for the values `10`, `2`, and `1`.
