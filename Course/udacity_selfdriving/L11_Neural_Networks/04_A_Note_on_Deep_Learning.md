## A Note on Deep Learning

The following lessons contain introductory and intermediate material on neural networks, building a neural network from scratch, using TensorFlow, and Convolutional Neural Networks:
- Introduction to Neural Networks
- MiniFlow
- Introduction to TensorFlow
- Deep Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks

While we highly suggest going through the all of the included content, if you already feel comfortable in any of these areas, feel free to skip ahead to later lessons. However, even if you have seen some of these topics before, it might be a good idea to get a refresher before you start working on the project!
