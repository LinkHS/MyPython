# Test

Once you've picked out your best model, it's time to test it!

1. Try to get the highest validation accuracy possible. Feel free to use all the previous concepts and train for as many epochs as needed.
2. Select your best model and train it one more time.
3. Use the test data and the [Keras `evaluate()`](https://keras.io/models/model/#evaluate) method to see how well the model does.
