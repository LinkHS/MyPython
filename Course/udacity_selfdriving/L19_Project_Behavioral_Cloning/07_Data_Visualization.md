If everything went correctly for recording data, you should see the following in the directory you selected:

1. `IMG` folder - this folder contains all the frames of your driving. 
2. `driving_log.csv` - each row in this sheet correlates your image with the steering angle, throttle, brake, and speed of your car. You'll mainly be using the steering angle.
