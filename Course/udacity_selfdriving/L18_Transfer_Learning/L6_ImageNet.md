ImageNet was its own competition from 2012-2017, but now it's hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-localization-challenge)! There are 1,000 different image categories between over 14 million images, so it's a great way to get involved with large datasets. 

Pre-training a network with the ImageNet dataset is a very common way to get a strong neural network that can be used for transfer learning. With recent versions of Keras, you can easily import a pre-trained network by using the [Keras Applications](https://keras.io/applications/) models. We'll come back to this soon.
